Webarchive (WAR) Agent

  This agent is most suitable for Java EE environments. It gets deployed
  as a usual web archive. The specific deployment procedure depends on
  the Java EE server in used. E.g. for Tomcat, copy the war agent into the <<<webapps/>>> directory.

  The war agent comes in two flavors:

    * <<<jolokia.war>>> which is secured with a role "jolokia". So you need to setup your servlet container to connect
      this role to your authentication setup (like the <<<tomcat-users.xml>>> for Tomcat)

    * <<<jolokia-unsecured.war>>> is completely unsecured and might be useful for a quick evaluation. <<Please note that this unauthenticated
      access should be ony used for development purposes. Check out {{{../reference/html/agents.html#agent-war-security}reference manual}} for details how to enable security.>>

  As soon as it is deployed, the agents offers its services under the
  URL of the deployed web application. For Tomcat running with its
  standard configuration the agent is then reachable under

------
http://localhost:8080/jolokia
------

   Setup and configuration of the WAR agent is explained detailed in
   the {{{../reference/html/agents.html#agents-war} reference manual}}.
